It represents a distributed data set that our beam pipeline operates on.\n","\n","o\t**Immutability:** Pcollections are immutable in nature. Applying a transformations on a pcollection results in creation of new pcollection.\n","\n","o\t**Element type:** The elements in pcollection may be of any type, but all must be of same type.\n","\n","o\t**Operation type:**  Pcollection does not support grained operations. We cannot apply transformations on specific elements in pcollection.\n","\n","o\t**Timestamps:** Each element in pcollection has an associated timestamp with it.\n","\n","o\t**Unbounded pcollections:** An unbounded PCollection represents a data set of unlimited size. Source assigns the timestamps.\n","\n","o\t**Bounded pcollections:** A bounded PCollection represents a data set of a known fixed size. Every element is set to same timestamp.\n","\n","o\t**No Random access:** Can’t access data using index or some specific element. No size restriction.\n","\n","o\t**Ptransform:** Ptransform represent a data processing operation, or a step in our pipeline.
